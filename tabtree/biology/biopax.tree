		BindingFeature a:owl/Class subclass-of:EntityFeature owl/disjointWith:FragmentFeature rdfs/comment:"Definition : An entity feature that represent the bound state of a physical entity. A pair of binding features represents a bond.\n\nRationale: A physical entity in a molecular complex is considered as a new state of an entity as it is structurally and functionally different. Binding features provide facilities for describing these states. Similar to other features, a molecule can have bound and not-bound states.\n\nUsage: Typically, binding features are present in pairs, each describing the binding characteristic for one of the interacting physical entities. One exception is using a binding feature with no paired feature to describe any potential binding. For example, an unbound receptor can be described by using a \'not-feature\' property with an unpaired binding feature as its value.  BindingSiteType and featureLocation allows annotating the binding location.\n\nIntraMolecular property should be set to \'true\' if the bond links two parts of the same molecule. A pair of binding features are still used where they are owned by the same physical entity.\n\nIf the binding is due to the covalent interactions, for example in the case of lipoproteins, CovalentBindingFeature subclass should be used instead of this class."
		BiochemicalPathwayStep a:owl/Class subclass-of:BiochemicalPathwayStep_1,PathwayStep rdfs/comment:"Definition: Imposes ordering on a step in a biochemical pathway.\nRetionale: A biochemical reaction can be reversible by itself, but can be physiologically directed in the context of a pathway, for instance due to flux of reactants and products.\nUsage: Only one conversion interaction can be ordered at a time, but multiple catalysis or modulation instances can be part of one step."

		BiochemicalReaction a:owl/Class subclass-of:Conversion owl/disjointWith:ComplexAssembly,Degradation rdfs/comment:"Definition: A conversion in which molecules of one or more physicalEntity pools, undergo covalent modifications and become a member of one or more other physicalEntity pools. The substrates of biochemical reactions are defined in terms of sums of species. This is a convention in biochemistry, and, in principle, all EC reactions should be biochemical reactions.\n\nExamples: ATP + H2O = ADP + Pi\n\nComment: In the example reaction above, ATP is considered to be an equilibrium mixture of several species, namely ATP4-, HATP3-, H2ATP2-, MgATP2-, MgHATP-, and Mg2ATP. Additional species may also need to be considered if other ions (e.g. Ca2+) that bind ATP are present. Similar considerations apply to ADP and to inorganic phosphate (Pi). When writing biochemical reactions, it is not necessary to attach charges to the biochemical reactants or to include ions such as H+ and Mg2+ in the equation. The reaction is written in the direction specified by the EC nomenclature system, if applicable, regardless of the physiological direction(s) in which the reaction proceeds. Polymerization reactions involving large polymers whose structure is not explicitly captured should generally be represented as unbalanced reactions in which the monomer is consumed but the polymer remains unchanged, e.g. glycogen + glucose = glycogen. A better coverage for polymerization will be developed."
		BioSource a:owl/Class subclass-of:UtilityClass owl/disjointWith:SequenceLocation,Stoichiometry,Provenance,Xref,DeltaG,EntityReference,EntityFeature,PathwayStep,Evidence,ExperimentalForm,Score,KPrime,ChemicalStructure,ControlledVocabulary rdfs/comment:"Definition: The biological source (organism, tissue or cell type) of an Entity.\n\nUsage: Some entities are considered source-neutral (e.g. small molecules), and the biological source of others can be deduced from their constituentss (e.g. complex, pathway).\n\nInstances: HeLa cells, Homo sapiens, and mouse liver tissue."
		Catalysis a:owl/Class subclass-of:Catalysis_3,Catalysis_2,Catalysis_1,Control owl/disjointWith:Modulation,TemplateReactionRegulation rdfs/comment:"Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity (a catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion interaction by lowering its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a catalyzing entity and a catalyzed conversion.\nRationale: Catalysis, theoretically, is always bidirectional since it acts by lowering the activation energy. Physiologically, however, it can have a direction because of the concentration of the participants. For example, the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by Isocitrate dehydrogenase always happens in one direction under physiological conditions since the produced carbon dioxide is constantly removed from the system.\n\nUsage: A separate catalysis instance should be created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity may catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a conversion. For example, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple different organisms could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction (a biochemical reaction is generic if it only includes small molecules). Generally, the enzyme catalyzing a conversion is known and the use of this class is obvious, however, in the cases where a catalyzed reaction is known to occur but the enzyme is not known, a catalysis instance can be created without a controller specified.\nSynonyms: facilitation, acceleration.\nExamples: The catalysis of a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a scaffold protein. Hexokinase -> (The \'Glucose + ATP -> Glucose-6-phosphate +ADP\' reaction). A plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase is an active transporter (antiport pump) using the energy of ATP to pump Na+ out of the cell and K+ in. Na+ from cytoplasm to extracellular space would be described in a transport instance. K+ from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis instance controlling each of the above transport instances. A biochemical reaction that does not occur by itself under physiological conditions, but has been observed to occur in the presence of cell extract, likely via one or more unknown enzymes present in the extract, would be stored in the CONTROLLED property, with the CONTROLLER property empty."

A complex is the physical product of an interaction (complexAssembly) and is not itself considered an interaction.\nThe boundaries on the size of complexes described by this class are not defined here, although possible, elements of the cell  such a mitochondria would typically not be described using this class (later versions of this ontology may include a cellularComponent class to represent these). The strength of binding cannot be described currently, but may be included in future versions of the ontology, depending on community need.\nExamples: Ribosome, RNA polymerase II. Other examples of this class include complexes of multiple protein monomers and complexes of proteins and small molecules."

		ComplexAssembly a:owl/Class subclass-of:Conversion owl/disjointWith:BiochemicalReaction,Transport,Degradation rdfs/comment:"Definition: A conversion interaction in which a set of physical entities, at least one being a macromolecule (e.g. protein, RNA, DNA), aggregate to from a complex physicalEntity. One of the participants of a complexAssembly must be an instance of the class Complex. The modification of the physicalentities involved in the ComplexAssembly is captured via BindingFeature class.\n\nUsage: This class is also used to represent complex disassembly. The assembly or disassembly of a complex is often a spontaneous process, in which case the direction of the complexAssembly (toward either assembly or disassembly) should be specified via the SPONTANEOUS property. Conversions in which participants obtain or lose CovalentBindingFeatures ( e.g. glycolysation of proteins) should be modeled with BiochemicalReaction.\n\nSynonyms: aggregation, complex formation\n\nExamples: Assembly of the TFB2 and TFB3 proteins into the TFIIH complex, and assembly of the ribosome through aggregation of its subunits."
		Control a:owl/Class subclass-of:Interaction owl/disjointWith:GeneticInteraction,Conversion,TemplateReaction,MolecularInteraction rdfs/comment:"Definition: An interaction in which one entity regulates, modifies, or otherwise influences a continuant entity, i.e. pathway or interaction.\n\nUsage: Conceptually, physical entities are involved in interactions (or events) and the events are controlled or modified, not the physical entities themselves. For example, a kinase activating a protein is a frequent event in signaling pathways and is usually represented as an 'activation' arrow from the kinase to the substrate in signaling diagrams. This is an abstraction, called \'Activity Flow\' representation,  that can be ambiguous without context. In BioPAX, this information should be captured as the kinase catalyzing (via an instance of the catalysis class) a Biochemical Reaction in which the substrate is phosphorylated.\nSubclasses of control define types specific to the biological process that is being controlled and should be used instead of the generic \'control\' class when applicable.\n\nA control can potentially have multiple controllers. This acts as a logical AND, i.e. both controllers are needed to regulate the  controlled event. Alternatively multiple controllers can control the same event and this acts as a logical OR, i.e. any one of them is sufficient to regulate the controlled event. Using this structure it is possible to describe arbitrary control logic using BioPAX.\n\nRationale: Control can be temporally non-atomic, for example a pathway can control another pathway in BioPAX.\nSynonyms: regulation, mediation\n\nExamples: A small molecule that inhibits a pathway by an unknown mechanism."
		ControlledVocabulary a:owl/Class subclass-of:ControlledVocabulary_1,UtilityClass owl/disjointWith:SequenceLocation,BioSource,Stoichiometry,Provenance,Xref,DeltaG,EntityReference,EntityFeature,PathwayStep,Evidence,ExperimentalForm,Score,KPrime,ChemicalStructure rdfs/comment:"Definition: This class represents a term from an external controlled vocabulary (CV).\nRationale: Controlled Vocabularies mark cases where BioPAX delegates the representation of a complex biological phenomena to an external controlled vocabulary development effort such as Gene Ontology. Each subclass of this class represents one such case and often has an associated \'Best-Practice\' external resource to use. See the documentation of each subclass for more specific information. Correct usage of controlled vocabularies are critical to data exchange and integration.\nUsage: The individuals belonging to this class must unambiguously refer to the source controlled vocabulary. This can be achieved in two manners:\nThe xref property of this class is restricted to the unification xref class. It must point to the source controlled vocabulary.\nAlternatively the rdf-id of the member individuals can be set to the designated MIRIAM URN.\nIt is a best practice to do both whenever possible.\nAlthough it is possible to use multiple unification xrefs to identify semantically identical terms across alternative controlled vocabularies, this is not a recommended practice as it might lead to maintenance issues as the controlled vocabularies change.\nThere is no recommended use-case for directly instantiating this class. Please use its subclasses instead."

		Conversion a:owl/Class subclass-of:Conversion_1,Interaction owl/disjointWith:GeneticInteraction,Control rdfs/comment:"Definition: An interaction in which molecules of one or more PhysicalEntity pools are physically transformed and become a member of one or more other PhysicalEntity pools.\nRationale: Conversion is Comments: Conversions in BioPAX are stoichiometric and closed world, i.e. it is assumed that all of the participants are listed. Both properties are due to the law of mass conservation.\nUsage: Subclasses of conversion represent different types of transformation reflected by the properties of different physicalEntity. BiochemicalReactions will change the ModificationFeatures on a PhysicalEntity, Transport will change the Cellular Location and ComplexAssembly will change BindingFeatures. Generic Conversion class should only be used when the modification does not fit into a any of these classes.\nExample: Opening of a voltage gated channel."

		CovalentBindingFeature a:owl/Class subclass-of:BindingFeature,ModificationFeature rdfs/comment:"Definition : An entity feature that represent the covalently bound state of  a physical entity.\n\nRationale: Most frequent covalent modifications to proteins and DNA, such as phosphorylation and metylation are covered by the ModificationFeature class. In these cases, the added groups are simple and stateless therefore they can be captured by a controlled vocabulary. In other cases, such as ThiS-Thilacyl-disulfide, the covalently linked molecules are best represented as a molecular complex. CovalentBindingFeature should be used to model such covalently linked complexes.\n\nUsage: Using this construct, it is possible to represent small molecules as a covalent complex of two other small molecules. The demarcation of small molecules is a general problem and is delegated to small molecule databases.The best practice is not to model using covalent complexes unless at least one of the participants is a protein, DNA or RNA.\n\nExamples:\ndisulfide bond\nUhpC + glc-6P -> Uhpc-glc-6p\nacetyl-ACP -> decenoyl-ACP\ncharged tRNA"
		Degradation a:owl/Class subclass-of:Degradation_1,Conversion owl/disjointWith:BiochemicalReaction,Transport,ComplexAssembly rdfs/comment:"Definition: A conversion in which a pool of macromolecules are degraded into their elementary units.\n\nUsage: This conversion always has a direction of left-to-right and is irreversible. Degraded molecules are always represented on the left, degradation products on the right.\n\nComments: Degradation is a complex abstraction over multiple reactions. Although it obeys law of mass conservation and stoichiometric, the products are rarely specified since they are ubiquitous.\n\nExample:  Degradation of a protein to amino acids."

		EntityFeature a:owl/Class subclass-of:UtilityClass owl/disjointWith:SequenceLocation,BioSource,Stoichiometry,Provenance,Xref,DeltaG,EntityReference,PathwayStep,Evidence,ExperimentalForm,Score,KPrime,ChemicalStructure,ControlledVocabulary rdfs/comment:"Description: A characteristic of a physical entity that can change while the entity still retains its biological identity.\n\nRationale: Two phosphorylated forms of a protein are strictly speaking different chemical  molecules. It is, however, standard in biology to treat them as different states of the same entity, where the entity is loosely defined based on sequence. Entity Feature class and its subclassses captures these variable characteristics. A Physical Entity in BioPAX represents a pool of  molecules rather than an individual molecule. This is a notion imported from chemistry( See PhysicalEntity). Pools are defined by a set of Entity Features in the sense that a single molecule must have all of the features in the set in order to be considered a member of the pool. Since it is impossible to list and experimentally test all potential features for an  entity, features that are not listed in the selection criteria is neglected Pools can also be defined by the converse by specifying features  that are known to NOT exist in a specific context. As DNA, RNA and Proteins can be hierarchically organized into families based on sequence homology so can entity features. The memberFeature property allows capturing such hierarchical classifications among entity features.\n\n\nUsage: Subclasses of entity feature describe most common biological instances and should be preferred whenever possible. One common usecase for instantiating  entity feature is, for describing active/inactive states of proteins where more specific feature information is not available.\n\nExamples: Open/close conformational state of channel proteins, \'active\'/\'inactive\' states, excited states of photoreactive groups."
		EntityReference a:owl/Class subclass-of:UtilityClass owl/disjointWith:SequenceLocation,BioSource,PhysicalEntity,Stoichiometry,Provenance,Xref,DeltaG,EntityFeature,PathwayStep,Evidence,ExperimentalForm,Score,KPrime,ChemicalStructure,ControlledVocabulary,SmallMolecule rdfs/comment:"Definition: An entity reference is a grouping of several physical entities across different contexts and molecular states, that share common physical properties and often named and treated as a single entity with multiple states by biologists.\n\nRationale:   Many protein, small molecule and gene databases share this point of view, and such a grouping is an important prerequisite for interoperability with those databases. Biologists would often group different pools of molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the cell's behavior, but they are still called calcium. For DNA, RNA and Proteins the grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for small molecules it is defined by the chemical structure.\n\nUsage: Entity references store the information common to a set of molecules in various states described in the BioPAX document, including database cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be phosphorylated in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) in a phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein (child of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins, including all possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to all of them and common references to protein databases containing more information about P53 would be stored in a Entity Reference.\n\nComments: This grouping has three semantic implications:\n\n1.  Members of different pools share many physical and biochemical properties. This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and set of molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation terms and database identifiers.\n\n2. A small number of transitions seperates these pools. In other words it is relatively easy and frequent for a molecule to transform from one physical entity to another that belong to the same reference entity. For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53 becomes mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a nuclear reaction, in the latter sheer statistical improbability of synthesizing the same sequence without a template. If one thinks about the biochemical network as molecules transforming into each other, and remove edges that respond to transcription, translation, degradation and covalent modification of small molecules, each remaining component is a reference entity.\n\n3. Some of the pools in the same group can overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the experiments in molecular biology will only check for one state variable, rarely multiple, and never for the all possible combinations. So almost all statements that refer to the state of the molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with other pools. However no overlaps is possible between molecules of different groups."

		Interaction a:owl/Class subclass-of:Entity owl/disjointWith:PhysicalEntity,Gene,Pathway rdfs/comment:"Definition: A biological relationship between two or more entities.\n\nRationale: In BioPAX, interactions are atomic from a database modeling perspective, i.e. interactions can not be decomposed into sub-interactions. When representing non-atomic continuants with explicit subevents the pathway class should be used instead. Interactions are not necessarily  temporally atomic, for example genetic interactions cover a large span of time. Interactions as a formal concept is a continuant, it retains its identitiy regardless of time, or any differences in specific states or properties.\n\nUsage: Interaction is a highly abstract class and in almost all cases it is more appropriate to use one of the subclasses of interaction.\nIt is partially possible to define generic reactions by using generic participants. A more comprehensive method is planned for BioPAX L4 for covering all generic cases like oxidization of a generic alcohol.\n\nSynonyms: Process, relationship, event.\n\nExamples: protein-protein interaction, biochemical reaction, enzyme catalysis"

For example, in the equilibrium constant equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate:\n\nK' = [ADP][P<sub>i</sub>]/[ATP],\n\nThe concentration of ATP refers to the total concentration of all of the following species:\n\n[ATP] = [ATP<sup>4-</sup>] + [HATP<sup>3-</sup>] + [H<sub>2</sub>ATP<sup>2-</sup>] + [MgATP<sup>2-</sup>] + [MgHATP<sup>-</sup>] + [Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP].\n\nThe apparent equilibrium constant is formally dimensionless, and can be kept so by inclusion of as many of the terms (1 mol/dm<sup>3</sup>) in the numerator or denominator as necessary.  It is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log<sub>10</sub>[Mg<sup>2+</sup>]). Therefore, these quantities must be specified to be precise, and values for KEQ for biochemical reactions may be represented as 5-tuples of the form (K' T I pH pMg).  This property may have multiple values, representing different measurements for K' obtained under the different experimental conditions listed in the 5-tuple.

		ModificationFeature a:owl/Class subclass-of:EntityFeature owl/disjointWith:FragmentFeature rdfs/comment:"Definition: An entity feature that represents  the covalently modified state of a dna, rna or a protein.\n\nRationale: In Biology, identity of DNA, RNA and Protein entities are defined around a wildtype sequence. Covalent modifications to this basal sequence are represented using modificaton features. Since small molecules are identified based on their chemical structure, not sequence, a covalent modification to a small molecule would result in a different molecule.\n\nUsage: The added groups should be simple and stateless, such as phosphate or methyl groups and are captured by the modificationType controlled vocabulary. In other cases, such as covalently linked proteins, use CovalentBindingFeature instead.\n\nInstances: A phosphorylation on a protein, a methylation on a DNA."
		Modulation a:owl/Class subclass-of:Modulation_2,Modulation_1,Control owl/disjointWith:Catalysis,TemplateReactionRegulation rdfs/comment:"Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity modulates a catalysis interaction.\n\nRationale: Biologically, most modulation interactions describe an interaction in which a small molecule alters the ability of an enzyme to catalyze a specific reaction. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a modulating entity and a catalysis interaction.\n\nUsage:  A typical modulation instance has a small molecule as the controller entity and a catalysis instance as the controlled entity. A separate modulation instance should be created for each different catalysis instance that a physical entity may modulate, and for each different physical entity that may modulate a catalysis instance.\nExamples: Allosteric activation and competitive inhibition of an enzyme's ability to catalyze a specific reaction."

		MolecularInteraction a:owl/Class subclass-of:MolecularInteraction_1,Interaction owl/disjointWith:GeneticInteraction,Control rdfs/comment:"Definition: An interaction in which participants bind physically to each other, directly or indirectly through intermediary molecules.\n\nRationale: There is a large body of interaction data, mostly produced by high throughput systems, that does not satisfy the level of detail required to model them with ComplexAssembly class. Specifically, what is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness (closed-world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes. Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured in BioPAX using this class.\n\nUsage: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANT slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If all participants are known with exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead.\n\nExample: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid experiment where there is not enough experimental evidence to suggest that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens."

It is also possible to define a pathway without specifying the interactions within the pathway. In this case, the pathway instance could consist simply of a name and could be treated as a 'black box'.  Pathways can also soverlap, i.e. a single interaction might belong to multiple pathways. Pathways can also contain sub-pathways. Pathways are continuants.\n\nSynonyms: network, module, cascade,\nExamples: glycolysis, valine biosynthesis, EGFR signaling"

For example,  if the pathway boundaries are based on a perturbation phenotype link, the pathway might start with the perturbing agent and end at gene expression leading to the observed changes. Pathway steps can represent directed compound graphs.\nUsage: Multiple interactions may occur in a pathway step, each should be listed in the stepProcess property. Order relationships between pathway steps may be established with the nextStep slot. If the reaction contained in the step is a reversible biochemical reaction but physiologically has a direction in the context of this pathway, use the subclass BiochemicalPathwayStep.\n\nExample: A metabolic pathway may contain a pathway step composed of one biochemical reaction (BR1) and one catalysis (CAT1) instance, where CAT1 describes the catalysis of BR1.

For example,  ser46 phosphorylated p53 is a physical entity in BioPAX defined by the p53 sequence and the phosphorylation feature on the serine at position 46 in the sequence.  Features are any combination of cellular location, covalent and non-covalent bonds with other molecules and covalent modifications.\n\nFor a specific molecule to be a member of the pool it has to satisfy all of the specified features. Unspecified features are treated as unknowns or unneccesary. Features that are known to not be on the molecules should be explicitly stated with the \'not feature\' property.\nA physical entity in BioPAX  never represents a specific molecular instance.\n\nPhysical Entity can be heterogenous and potentially overlap, i.e. a single molecule can be counted as a member of multiple pools.

If that is the case and the controller, under biological conditions, is always catalyzing the conversion in one direction then this fact can be\ncaptured using this property. If the enzyme is active for both\ndirections, or the conversion is not bidirectional, this property should\nbe left empty."

Compounds that activate the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism.

Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.\n\nThe following terms can only be used in the modulation class (these definitions from EcoCyc):\nINHIBITION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric inhibitors decrease the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that decreases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX. Allosteric inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors, therefore, those inhibition categories can be used in conjunction with this category.\n\nINHIBITION-COMPETITIVE\nCompetitive inhibitors are compounds that competitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and preventing the substrate from binding. Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme. A competitive inhibitor can either bind to the active site of the enzyme, directly excluding the substrate from binding there, or it can bind to another site on the enzyme, altering the conformation of the enzyme such that the substrate can not bind to the active site.\n\nINHIBITION-IRREVERSIBLE\nIrreversible inhibitors are compounds that irreversibly inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme and dissociating so slowly that it is considered irreversible. For example, alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.\n\nINHIBITION-NONCOMPETITIVE\nNoncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that noncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme by binding reversibly to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other. However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.\n\nINHIBITION-OTHER\nCompounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized, but that cannot be clearly classified as irreversible, competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or allosteric.\n\nINHIBITION-UNCOMPETITIVE\nUncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that uncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone.\n\nACTIVATION-NONALLOSTERIC\nNonallosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by means other than allosteric.\n\nACTIVATION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX."
