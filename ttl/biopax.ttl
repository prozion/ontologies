:CovalentBindingFeature a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment """Definition : An entity feature that represent the covalently bound state of  a physical entity.

Rationale: Most frequent covalent modifications to proteins and DNA, such as phosphorylation and metylation are covered by the ModificationFeature class. In these cases, the added groups are simple and stateless therefore they can be captured by a controlled vocabulary. In other cases, such as ThiS-Thilacyl-disulfide, the covalently linked molecules are best represented as a molecular complex. CovalentBindingFeature should be used to model such covalently linked complexes.

Usage: Using this construct, it is possible to represent small molecules as a covalent complex of two other small molecules. The demarcation of small molecules is a general problem and is delegated to small molecule databases.The best practice is not to model using covalent complexes unless at least one of the participants is a protein, DNA or RNA.

Examples:
disulfide bond
UhpC + glc-6P -> Uhpc-glc-6p
acetyl-ACP -> decenoyl-ACP

:TransportWithBiochemicalReaction a owl:Class ;

In transportWithBiochemicalReaction interactions, one or more of the substrates changes both their location and their physical structure. Active transport reactions that use ATP as an energy source fall under this category, even if the only covalent change is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.

Rationale: This class was added to support a large number of transport events in pathway databases that have a biochemical reaction during the transport process. It is not expected that other double inheritance subclasses will be added to the ontology at the same level as this class.

Examples: In the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system, transportation of sugar into an E. coli cell is accompanied by the sugar's phosphorylation as it crosses the plasma membrane."""^^xsd:string ;

on one side of the chemical equilibrium. For example E.Coli's lac operon ensures that lacZ gene is only synthesized when there is enough lactose in the medium.  If that is the case and the controller, under biological conditions, is always catalyzing the conversion in one direction then this fact can be
captured using this property. If the enzyme is active for both

For example, in the equilibrium constant equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate:

It is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log<sub>10</sub>[Mg<sup>2+</sup>]).

Rationale: There is a large body of interaction data, mostly produced by high throughput systems, that does not satisfy the level of detail required to model them with ComplexAssembly class. Specifically, what is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness (closed-world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes. Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured in BioPAX using this class.

Usage: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANT slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If all participants are known with exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead.

The following terms are possible values:

ACTIVATION: General activation. Compounds that activate the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.

The following term can not be used in the catalysis class:
INHIBITION: General inhibition. Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.

The following terms can only be used in the modulation class (these definitions from EcoCyc):
INHIBITION-ALLOSTERIC
Allosteric inhibitors decrease the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that decreases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX. Allosteric inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors, therefore, those inhibition categories can be used in conjunction with this category.

INHIBITION-COMPETITIVE
Competitive inhibitors are compounds that competitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and preventing the substrate from binding. Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme. A competitive inhibitor can either bind to the active site of the enzyme, directly excluding the substrate from binding there, or it can bind to another site on the enzyme, altering the conformation of the enzyme such that the substrate can not bind to the active site.

INHIBITION-IRREVERSIBLE
Irreversible inhibitors are compounds that irreversibly inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme and dissociating so slowly that it is considered irreversible. For example, alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.

INHIBITION-NONCOMPETITIVE
Noncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that noncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme by binding reversibly to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other. However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.

INHIBITION-OTHER
Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized, but that cannot be clearly classified as irreversible, competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or allosteric.

INHIBITION-UNCOMPETITIVE
Uncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that uncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone.

ACTIVATION-NONALLOSTERIC
Nonallosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by means other than allosteric.

ACTIVATION-ALLOSTERIC
Allosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX."""^^xsd:string ;

Usage: For example, if one wished to link from a database record, C, describing a chemical compound in a BioPAX data collection to a record, C', describing the same chemical compound in an external database, one would use a unification xref since records C and C' describe the same biological identity. Generally, unification xrefs should be used whenever possible, although there are cases where they might not be useful, such as application to application data exchange.Identity of interactions can be computed based on the  identity of its participants.

:Catalysis a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment """Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity (a catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion interaction by lowering its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a catalyzing entity and a catalyzed conversion.
Rationale: Catalysis, theoretically, is always bidirectional since it acts by lowering the activation energy. Physiologically, however, it can have a direction because of the concentration of the participants. For example, the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by Isocitrate dehydrogenase always happens in one direction under physiological conditions since the produced carbon dioxide is constantly removed from the system.

Usage: A separate catalysis instance should be created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity may catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a conversion. For example, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple different organisms could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction (a biochemical reaction is generic if it only includes small molecules). Generally, the enzyme catalyzing a conversion is known and the use of this class is obvious, however, in the cases where a catalyzed reaction is known to occur but the enzyme is not known, a catalysis instance can be created without a controller specified.

Examples: The catalysis of a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a scaffold protein. Hexokinase -> (The "Glucose + ATP -> Glucose-6-phosphate +ADP" reaction). A plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase is an active transporter (antiport pump) using the energy of ATP to pump Na+ out of the cell and K+ in. Na+ from cytoplasm to extracellular space would be described in a transport instance. K+ from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis instance controlling each of the above transport instances. A biochemical reaction that does not occur by itself under physiological conditions, but has been observed to occur in the presence of cell extract, likely via one or more unknown enzymes present in the extract, would be stored in the CONTROLLED property, with the CONTROLLER property empty."""^^xsd:string ;

Rationale: A physical entity in a molecular complex is considered as a new state of an entity as it is structurally and functionally different. Binding features provide facilities for describing these states. Similar to other features, a molecule can have bound and not-bound states.

Usage: Typically, binding features are present in pairs, each describing the binding characteristic for one of the interacting physical entities. One exception is using a binding feature with no paired feature to describe any potential binding. For example, an unbound receptor can be described by using a "not-feature" property with an unpaired binding feature as its value.  BindingSiteType and featureLocation allows annotating the binding location.

IntraMolecular property should be set to "true" if the bond links two parts of the same molecule. A pair of binding features are still used where they are owned by the same physical entity.

Comment: In the example reaction above, ATP is considered to be an equilibrium mixture of several species, namely ATP4-, HATP3-, H2ATP2-, MgATP2-, MgHATP-, and Mg2ATP.

In this case, the pathway instance could consist simply of a name and could be treated as a 'black box'.  Pathways can also soverlap, i.e. a single interaction might belong to multiple pathways. Pathways can also contain sub-pathways. Pathways are continuants.

:Control a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment """Definition: An interaction in which one entity regulates, modifies, or otherwise influences a continuant entity, i.e. pathway or interaction.

Usage: Conceptually, physical entities are involved in interactions (or events) and the events are controlled or modified, not the physical entities themselves. For example, a kinase activating a protein is a frequent event in signaling pathways and is usually represented as an 'activation' arrow from the kinase to the substrate in signaling diagrams. This is an abstraction, called "Activity Flow" representation,  that can be ambiguous without context. In BioPAX, this information should be captured as the kinase catalyzing (via an instance of the catalysis class) a Biochemical Reaction in which the substrate is phosphorylated.
Subclasses of control define types specific to the biological process that is being controlled and should be used instead of the generic "control" class when applicable.

A control can potentially have multiple controllers. This acts as a logical AND, i.e. both controllers are needed to regulate the  controlled event. Alternatively multiple controllers can control the same event and this acts as a logical OR, i.e. any one of them is sufficient to regulate the controlled event. Using this structure it is possible to describe arbitrary control logic using BioPAX.

Rationale: Control can be temporally non-atomic, for example a pathway can control another pathway in BioPAX.

Usage: Concentrations in the equilibrium constant equation refer to the total concentrations of  all forms of particular biochemical reactants. For example, in the equilibrium constant equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate:

K' = [ADP][P<sub>i</sub>]/[ATP],

The concentration of ATP refers to the total concentration of all of the following species:

[ATP] = [ATP<sup>4-</sup>] + [HATP<sup>3-</sup>] + [H<sub>2</sub>ATP<sup>2-</sup>] + [MgATP<sup>2-</sup>] + [MgHATP<sup>-</sup>] + [Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP].

The apparent equilibrium constant is formally dimensionless, and can be kept so by inclusion of as many of the terms (1 mol/dm<sup>3</sup>) in the numerator or denominator as necessary.  It is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log<sub>10</sub>[Mg<sup>2+</sup>]). Therefore, these quantities must be specified to be precise, and values for KEQ for biochemical reactions may be represented as 5-tuples of the form (K' T I pH pMg).  This property may have multiple values, representing different measurements for K' obtained under the different experimental conditions listed in the 5-tuple. (This definition adapted from EcoCyc)

:EntityFeature a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment """Description: A characteristic of a physical entity that can change while the entity still retains its biological identity.

Rationale: Two phosphorylated forms of a protein are strictly speaking different chemical  molecules. It is, however, standard in biology to treat them as different states of the same entity, where the entity is loosely defined based on sequence. Entity Feature class and its subclassses captures these variable characteristics. A Physical Entity in BioPAX represents a pool of  molecules rather than an individual molecule. This is a notion imported from chemistry( See PhysicalEntity). Pools are defined by a set of Entity Features in the sense that a single molecule must have all of the features in the set in order to be considered a member of the pool. Since it is impossible to list and experimentally test all potential features for an  entity, features that are not listed in the selection criteria is neglected Pools can also be defined by the converse by specifying features  that are known to NOT exist in a specific context. As DNA, RNA and Proteins can be hierarchically organized into families based on sequence homology so can entity features. The memberFeature property allows capturing such hierarchical classifications among entity features.


Usage: Subclasses of entity feature describe most common biological instances and should be preferred whenever possible. One common usecase for instantiating  entity feature is, for describing active/inactive states of proteins where more specific feature information is not available.

Examples: Open/close conformational state of channel proteins, "active"/"inactive" states, excited states of photoreactive groups."""^^xsd:string ;

Rationale: Controlled Vocabularies mark cases where BioPAX delegates the representation of a complex biological phenomena to an external controlled vocabulary development effort such as Gene Ontology. Each subclass of this class represents one such case and often has an associated "Best-Practice" external resource to use. See the documentation of each subclass for more specific information. Correct usage of controlled vocabularies are critical to data exchange and integration.
Usage: The individuals belonging to this class must unambiguously refer to the source controlled vocabulary. This can be achieved in two manners:
The xref property of this class is restricted to the unification xref class. It must point to the source controlled vocabulary.
Alternatively the rdf-id of the member individuals can be set to the designated MIRIAM URN.
It is a best practice to do both whenever possible.
Although it is possible to use multiple unification xrefs to identify semantically identical terms across alternative controlled vocabularies, this is not a recommended practice as it might lead to maintenance issues as the controlled vocabularies change.

:PhysicalEntity a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment """Definition: A pool of molecules or molecular complexes.

Comments: Each PhysicalEntity is defined by a  sequence or structure based on an EntityReference AND any set of Features that are given. For example,  ser46 phosphorylated p53 is a physical entity in BioPAX defined by the p53 sequence and the phosphorylation feature on the serine at position 46 in the sequence.  Features are any combination of cellular location, covalent and non-covalent bonds with other molecules and covalent modifications.

For a specific molecule to be a member of the pool it has to satisfy all of the specified features. Unspecified features are treated as unknowns or unneccesary. Features that are known to not be on the molecules should be explicitly stated with the "not feature" property.
A physical entity in BioPAX  never represents a specific molecular instance.

Physical Entity can be heterogenous and potentially overlap, i.e. a single molecule can be counted as a member of multiple pools. This makes BioPAX semantics different than regular chemical notation but is necessary for dealing with combinatorial complexity.

:EntityReference a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment """Definition: An entity reference is a grouping of several physical entities across different contexts and molecular states, that share common physical properties and often named and treated as a single entity with multiple states by biologists.

Rationale:   Many protein, small molecule and gene databases share this point of view, and such a grouping is an important prerequisite for interoperability with those databases. Biologists would often group different pools of molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the cell's behavior, but they are still called calcium. For DNA, RNA and Proteins the grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for small molecules it is defined by the chemical structure.

Usage: Entity references store the information common to a set of molecules in various states described in the BioPAX document, including database cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be phosphorylated in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) in a phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein (child of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins, including all possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to all of them and common references to protein databases containing more information about P53 would be stored in a Entity Reference.

Comments: This grouping has three semantic implications:

1.  Members of different pools share many physical and biochemical properties. This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and set of molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation terms and database identifiers.

2. A small number of transitions seperates these pools. In other words it is relatively easy and frequent for a molecule to transform from one physical entity to another that belong to the same reference entity. For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53 becomes mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a nuclear reaction, in the latter sheer statistical improbability of synthesizing the same sequence without a template. If one thinks about the biochemical network as molecules transforming into each other, and remove edges that respond to transcription, translation, degradation and covalent modification of small molecules, each remaining component is a reference entity.

3. Some of the pools in the same group can overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the experiments in molecular biology will only check for one state variable, rarely multiple, and never for the all possible combinations. So almost all statements that refer to the state of the molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with other pools. However no overlaps is possible between molecules of different groups."""^^xsd:string ;
